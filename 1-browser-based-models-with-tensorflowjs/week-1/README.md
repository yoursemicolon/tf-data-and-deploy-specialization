# Introduction to TensorFlow.js

How do you take that model and have it be running 24/7, have it serve actual user queries, and create value? Yes, by deploying the model.

TensorFlow allows you to do neural network training and inference right there in your web browser without needing to send that image up to the cloud to be processed by a server. So, you're going to save time on the round tripping or if in a scenario if you're doing it on mobile for example that you don't even need to be connected. 

## Getting the System Ready
